# project_manager
A set of bash functions to manage projects.
Originally created to familiarize myself with shell scripting and result in a usable set of scripts to help organize projects.
Although this project was beneficial as a way to toy with bash, I would not reccomend using this to organize your files, I can not verify it is functional and it enforces a directory structure that is somewhat limited.
